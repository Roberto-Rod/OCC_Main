function [PCpos, PCht, weight]=find_all_peaks_jr(indAC,pos,data,slopecorr, fit, nc, res)
% Description: Find the PC peak position by looking for the peak with
% greatest prominence wrt the right neigbouring peak, and fitting a
% quadratic curve. Preferably use it after filtering the signal with a matched
% filter so the profiles of the peaks are more well defined and smoother (less number of peaks too).
% The weights determine the quality of the scan being considered and are
% calculated as the difference of the prominence of the PC peak and the
% second highest prominence within peaks to the left of PC.

% Inputs:
%        ACpos: Position of the AC peak found before using findAC_quad. It
%        is used to find the window where to look for the PC peak
%        pos: Array of positions
%        data: It contains a single scan (ideally, an averaged and matched filtered scan)
%        fit: If fit=1, we fit a quadratic to the PC peak, ow, we pick the
%        height of the detected peak.
% Outputs:
%        PCpos: Position of the PC peak
%        ref: Quality of the scan (Weight)
