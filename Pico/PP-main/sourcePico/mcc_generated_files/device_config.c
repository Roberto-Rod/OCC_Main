 Return Value   : None

 Description    : The MPLAB project is set for the C99 standard. Therefore, in order
                  to eliminate the following Build Warning,
                  "warning: ISO C requires a translation unit to contain at least one declaration [-Wempty-translation-unit]"
                  This 'dummy' function with no functionality has been added to 
                  this module (i.e. Translation unit).
                  Note however, that a "warning: (520) function "_dummy_Initialize" is never called"
                  will occur instead. This warning is deemed permissible for the project.
